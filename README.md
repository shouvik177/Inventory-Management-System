Inventory Management System - Django Backend
This project is a simple Inventory Management System built using the Django framework. The system provides backend APIs for managing inventory items, including functionality to create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. The Django REST Framework is used for creating API endpoints, while the admin interface is used for managing data via a web interface.

Features:
CRUD Operations: Full support for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on inventory items.
Django Admin Interface: Manage inventory items through Django's built-in admin dashboard.
REST API: Expose endpoints for interacting with inventory items using JSON format.
Redis Caching: Optimized data access using Redis caching for frequently accessed data.
Database Management: Models are set up with migrations for seamless integration with the database.
Field Validation: All fields are validated to ensure data integrity.
Technologies Used:
Django: Backend web framework
Django REST Framework: For building APIs
Redis: For caching and improving performance
PostgreSQL: For database management
